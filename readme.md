# Nancy HTTP server

This project provides an ASP.NET HTTP server, that allows running the Deterministic Network Calculus algorithms of the [Nancy library](https://github.com/rzippo/nancy) remotely or from another language, via its HTTP API.

See the [tests](./tests/) folder for examples of using the API, and [nancy-java-wrapper](https://github.com/rzippo/nancy-java-wrapper) for an example of how to use this to run Nancy algorithms from other languages.
